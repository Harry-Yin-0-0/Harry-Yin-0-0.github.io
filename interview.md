III. Content of the Interview
 
1.	Yin: My name is Haozhe (Harry) Yin, and I am currently studying at Wyoming Seminary in Pennsylvania, USA. I am graduating from high school next year. I saw on television that you recently received the National Outstanding Engineer Award, and I greatly admire you. It is an honor to interview you today. I hope to learn about your experiences, gain insights and advice, and receive guidance for my future development. Could you please start by introducing yourself?
Zhang: My profession is meteorological satellite remote sensing. The main activities in the meteorological industry are composed of observation, forecasting, and services. My work involves satellite planning and design for weather and meteorological services. I’ve basically been doing this for my entire life.

2.	Yin: Can you look back on your middle school and college years and share any experiences that left a deep impression or had a significant impact on you?
Zhang: For those of us born in the 1960s, our era coincided with the reinstatement of the national college entrance examination. In middle school, our focus was on studying for this exam. I remember that our school was one of the examination centers, and the school selected top students to assist with maintaining order in the examination halls. What left the deepest impression on me was seeing the reactions of those who completed the exam—some were happy, others sighed, and still others lamented about mistakes they made. This experience gave me a real sense of the tension around the college entrance examination. Later, when I took my own exams, these memories reminded me to stay cautious and prepared. In the 1980s, university students were called "Heaven's Favored Ones." Whether you went to college or not could greatly impact your life path during that time. University laid the foundation for our future interests and pursuits. In college, we had the opportunity to attend lectures by renowned personalities, scholars, and sociologists. The library was filled with books stacked like mountains, which made me realize how little I knew and how much there was to learn. During my college years, I read not only books related to my major but also literature and other fields. I also worked in the student union, which honed my organizational and leadership skills.

3.	Yin: Who had the most influence on your growth, and how did they inspire or help you?
Zhang: If we’re talking about influential people, I must mention a high school math teacher named Xu Bencheng. His teaching method was unique compared to others. He would ask us to read the content thoroughly before class, then let us raise any questions we had, which he listed on the blackboard before addressing them one by one. This method instilled in me a strong sense of self-learning, which has been beneficial throughout my life.

4. Yin: Did you encounter any difficulties in your work, and how did you overcome them?
Zhang: When we started working, China was just beginning to develop meteorological satellites, and none of us had any experience—whether it was our senior colleagues, those who joined a few years before us, or the newcomers like myself. We were all starting from scratch, with no one to teach us how to proceed. So, what did we do? We consulted resources. I frequently visited our satellite center’s library and the National Library. After thoroughly researching and understanding what we needed to do, we looked at how others had approached similar tasks. At that time, the biggest difficulty we faced was that there was no existing experience to draw from, and we had to build everything from the ground up. In such circumstances, we could only rely on ourselves, exploring step by step, gradually accumulating knowledge. Although progress was initially slow, once we passed the initial exploratory phase, things moved much faster. As the saying goes, "All beginnings are difficult," but as long as you persevere, you can overcome those initial challenges.

5. Yin: As an outstanding leader in your field, what are your thoughts and expectations for the future development of satellite meteorology?
Zhang: Our work focuses on observation, and now meteorological observation is the foundation for both weather forecasting and digital weather forecasting. Advancements in observation technology also drive improvements in forecasting technology. If you want to use new data methods in forecasting, you need to plan observational techniques well in advance, and without a ten-year head start, it’s impossible to develop new forecasting methods today. Our fundamental goal is to make accurate weather forecasts. Meteorologists have many dreams that need our help to come true—they wanted satellites to photograph Earth, and we made it happen; they wanted infrared hyperspectral imaging for the clear-sky atmospheric structure, and we achieved that too. However, the use of infrared hyperspectral for in-cloud structures is not possible—it can only be used for clear skies. Given that 70% of Earth is covered by clouds, we need to rely on microwave technology to achieve this goal. However, before improving technical methods, we need innovative thinking. Facing problems requires breaking traditional ways of thinking and innovating solutions to solve practical issues. Now, we meteorologists have another dream—to place microwave observation equipment on geostationary satellites, and we are currently working on it. Once we resolve the internal and below-cloud observations with microwaves, we will need radar to detect cloud microphysical structures like ice crystals and cloud droplets. However, due to technological limitations, meteorological satellite radar currently only operates in low-Earth orbit. One of our future dreams is to put a precipitation radar on geostationary satellites. This is what we are working towards. If we manage to realize these meteorologists' dreams step by step, overcoming the technical barriers, we will better serve humanity as a whole. In my view, future geostationary satellites must have microwave capabilities, and once we achieve that, we need to integrate precipitation radar and cloud radar into geostationary satellites—that’s our goal for the future.

6. Yin: As an outstanding scientist, what advice would you give to young people who aspire to become like you? What qualities or approaches do they need to succeed?
Zhang: When someone’s work aligns with their passion, they find true happiness. So the first thing is to ensure that your major and your interests align. But that’s just the foundation—it doesn’t automatically mean success. Nowadays, many projects are multidisciplinary, and it’s impossible for one person or one discipline to solve everything. Team spirit and collaboration are crucial. If you’re the leader of a team, you must continue learning new things. If I don’t fully understand something, I will keep asking questions until it is clear to me—having that persistence is key. Our work often takes years to show results; projects can take five, ten, or even more years to yield tangible outcomes. It requires persistence, patience, and staying grounded without seeking fame or profit. Only through perseverance can you truly succeed.

7. Yin: When did you establish your life goals—was it during university or after starting work?
Zhang: If we’re talking about having real life goals, I would say it was after university. University is a turning point. In middle school, the goal is to get into university, but you’re not sure what you want to do—just a general direction. The foundation was truly built in university. Without systematic study in university, I wouldn’t be able to do what I do now. University laid the foundation for my life’s goals.

8. Yin: How did your middle school and university education and experiences help you in your current work and other aspects of life?
Zhang: I believe that any learning process is complete when viewed as a whole. Middle school education provided us with foundational knowledge in math, physics, chemistry, and biology—all essential basics. Now, students often have broad interests, and by the time they reach university, it’s crucial to not only master their major but also read extensively in other fields. You never know when different pieces of knowledge will become useful. For those working in multidisciplinary fields, the ability to make analogies across domains is especially valuable. It’s easier to understand one field when you have a foundational understanding of others, which makes integrating them more feasible. As a chief designer, I need to be sharp at critical points, and if I fail to make essential judgments, the entire project may collapse. This is vital for my role.

9. Yin: How did you continuously accumulate experience, improve yourself step by step, and ultimately achieve success?
Zhang: I have a particular characteristic—I'm obedient. I do what I'm told. When I first started working, we were dealing with complex equipment. We had to receive satellite data, which required calculating satellite orbits, and controlling the antennas was impossible manually—it had to be done by computer. There were technical difficulties, like the receiver and synchronizer, among other specialized aspects. Every time there was a piece of equipment that no one wanted to handle or manage, the leaders would assign it to me. Initially, I was tasked with satellite orbit work, which wasn’t my area of expertise, so I found resources and taught myself the fundamentals of orbit determination and forecasting. This expanded my knowledge. Later, I faced another challenge: computer control systems. The computer manuals were all in English, and I was asked to take on the task, so I learned computer control principles from scratch. Through these challenges, I kept learning. When I eventually became a chief designer, I realized all the knowledge I had accumulated formed a solid foundation for me. By that time, I didn’t need to spend my energy on familiar topics and could focus all my efforts on new challenges. Reflecting now, it's essential for young people to take on more responsibilities, not shy away from new problems, be willing to do tasks beyond their comfort zone, and not fear menial work. It’s beneficial for future work.

10. Yin: What advice would you give to my generation, whether in studies, work, or life?
Zhang: I envy your generation—the 2000s—you are so fortunate. Your material conditions are great, and you have much better access to knowledge than we did. Watching TV was a luxury for us, but now, aside from school, you have television, radio, and the internet. Accessing information is so easy. But that also means your generation faces new challenges. Everyone has such good conditions, so if you want to stand out, the pressure is greater. Success requires even more effort than before—it's not going to be easy. You need to work harder and learn more than others. Additionally, you need to care about broader human issues, such as climate change, resource scarcity, and global challenges. As someone who works with satellite observations, I see Earth as one entity, a human matter. Your generation should be more concerned with humanity and technological development. We are said to be approaching the fourth technological revolution—the first three being the mechanical age, the electrical age, and the information age. Technology is advancing, and it’s impossible for one person to master everything, so it’s important to identify where your interests lie early on and set your direction. I hope that, like me, you will be able to pursue your passion—there’s no greater happiness than that.

11. Yin: When did you discover your interest in meteorological observation, and how did you choose to pursue this path? Did you know when you first chose your major in college, or did you decide later during your studies after discovering your interest?
Zhang: For our generation, including myself, the choice of career was largely passive. When we graduated, we were assigned to work units by the state; we didn’t choose our job, it was decided by our school. My current employer came to our university to recruit graduates, and I was recommended by the school. I majored in radio technology, and over all these years of work, I found that even with all the knowledge I learned, it wasn't enough, because my work involves meteorological satellite observation, which is multidisciplinary—covering atmospheric science, astronomy, meteorology, radio technology, automatic control, and more. I realized that all the knowledge I had wasn't enough to fully meet the needs of my work. My interest in this field developed mostly passively, but it turned out to be a perfect fit. Nowadays, young people have many options, conditions have changed, and you have much more flexibility to actively choose what you love and pursue it.

12. Yin: What do you believe is the most important reason for your success, or what personal trait contributed to your success?
Zhang: I think personal factors play a smaller role in our case. My personal trait is that I always strive to do everything to the best of my ability. Whatever task I am assigned, I try to do it to perfection—to a level that I personally consider the best. But when it comes to my success, it's not just about individual effort. To me, if I’ve achieved success, it’s the success of our field. Our nation needed meteorological satellites to improve weather prediction accuracy, to aid in disaster prevention, and to reduce losses of lives and property. Another factor is timing. I happened to be in the right place at the right time to contribute to this work, which was a unique opportunity given to our generation. So, it's not just about personal effort; success requires a combination of the right timing, the right environment, and human collaboration—what we call "time, place, and people." I think it’s these three aspects that have led to my success.

Yin: Thank you very much for accepting my interview. I've gained a lot from our conversation.
Zhang: I hope you can get into an ideal university.
 
Section Four: Reflections and Analysis from the Interview
1. The Importance of Learning
Through this interview, I’ve become more aware of the importance of learning. As a high school student, learning is extremely significant for me—not only to acquire knowledge and improve skills, but also as a crucial process for shaping myself and planning for the future. It helps us adapt to changes. To succeed, one must keep learning and constantly improve oneself. In this era of rapid development, knowledge updates quickly, and only by continuous learning can we keep pace and achieve our goals. As Einstein said, "Learning is a never-ending process, and only by continuous learning can one remain competitive." I must cherish this valuable time to learn, explore, and challenge myself to lay a solid foundation for my future.

2. Establishing Life Goals
Standing at the crossroads of youth, I, like many other American high school students, have dreams and hopes and often reflect on myself, thinking about and planning for my future development. This interview made me realize my interests, strengths, and weaknesses more clearly. I started to think about how to combine my knowledge with future career planning, and to set clearer goals and plans.

In this information explosion and ever-changing era, we face new technologies such as AI, new energy, and life sciences. I am eager to learn these new technologies and become someone who can lead trends and change the world. Besides learning new technologies, learning to collaborate with others is equally important, which requires greater wisdom. To go further, we need to make even more effort. Through this interview with Mr. Zhang Zhiqing, I have learned a lot. One of the most important factors in achieving success is to have clear life goals. I believe that only by setting life goals can one have a clearer path for the future, better realize personal value, and enhance happiness through effort. One can become someone who is valuable to society, make contributions to society and humanity, and give back by spreading love and warmth, allowing more people to feel the care and warmth of society.

3. Facing Difficulties and Challenges with Positivity
On the path of growth, no one can avoid various difficulties. When faced with difficulties, we must confront them courageously instead of avoiding or denying their existence. First, we need to maintain an optimistic attitude, as optimism can stimulate our internal drive to move forward. Challenges make us grow and become stronger and more confident. By being proactive, we can find effective solutions, so in difficult situations, we must maintain firm confidence and unwavering effort, believing we can overcome challenges. Ultimately, if we work hard, we can emerge from difficulties and reach the shore of success.

4. Fostering Innovative Thinking
Whether in learning or work, we often encounter new problems that require us to think and solve. Many problems are difficult to solve using traditional thinking alone. Only by breaking out of traditional constraints can we develop better ideas. Innovation is not just a skill or method but also a habit of thinking and attitude that drives social progress, technological development, and personal growth. In today’s rapidly changing era, developing innovative thinking is crucial for personal growth, technological advancement, and social progress. Innovation enables us to discover and think about problems differently, especially in engineering fields that I am interested in. It helps us come up with new solutions and deepen our understanding. Innovation knows no age limits; I must continuously improve my mindset and cultivate an awareness of innovation. Active thinking generates more creative ideas. At the same time, I understand that critical thinking is an essential foundation of innovation. Critical thinking enhances one’s capacity to solve complex problems effectively.

5. Persistence is Key
To do something well, passion alone is not enough—it requires persistence. Persistence is key to achieving success. From Mr. Zhang’s journey to success, I have deeply understood the significant rewards of perseverance. It’s not just an attitude but a force that drives us forward. In the future, no matter the challenges, I will remind myself to persist, to not give up easily, and to work steadily and consistently on every task, gradually realizing my career plan and goals. I will keep challenging myself to achieve higher goals. I believe that persistence will take me further and more steadily on my life’s journey.

6. Importance of Teamwork
Mr. Zhang emphasized the importance of teamwork. No matter the situation, completing a task or achieving a goal requires collaboration. I believe a team’s strength far exceeds an individual's. When faced with challenges, team members can support each other. Teamwork not only improves efficiency but also enhances quality. Through teamwork, members can share their strengths and work together towards common goals. Effective teamwork is about emphasizing cooperation and support, as no one can solve all problems alone. Teamwork is like a tug-of-war—only when everyone pulls together with a common goal can the team maximize its potential and achieve shared objectives.

Section Five: Interview Summary
As high school comes to an end, this interview provided me with a rare opportunity to explore and learn about the external world, as well as to reflect on myself and grow. I have gained valuable insights and experiences that will pave the way for my future. Learning is crucial for everyone—it is not an endpoint but an ongoing journey. Knowledge is the source of human progress, helping us understand and reshape the world. Only by continuously enhancing learning can we adapt to changes and realize our potential. Furthermore, to accomplish anything, both effort and persistence are necessary. Faced with difficulties and challenges, one must maintain confidence, improve traditional thinking, and innovate. Everyone has limits, and teamwork is essential for success.

Although compared to previous generations, my generation has superior conditions, there are still many unknown fields to explore. I cannot settle for the present; I must take Mr. Zhang as a role model, constantly push myself, and aim for my goals to contribute to social progress.

Section Six: epilogue
I am especially grateful to Mr. Zhang Zhiqing for his generosity in sharing his knowledge and experience with me during this interview. His wisdom is a valuable asset on my life journey. I will cherish the remaining days of high school, which have witnessed my growth. This interview has been a memorable experience that strengthened my beliefs and dreams and laid the foundation for a new chapter. In the future, I will move forward with courage, always striving for a better version of myself.
